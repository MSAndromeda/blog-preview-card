## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (variables)
- Flexbox
- Clamp for responsive typography
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge helped me understand the importance of accessibility (like using `aria-label`), RTL-friendly layout techniques using logical properties, and modern responsive techniques like `clamp()` for fluid font sizes.

### Continued development

I plan to improve:

- Accessibility further using roles and better ARIA practices
- Responsive scaling using `container queries`
- Component reusability using frameworks like React

### Useful resources
